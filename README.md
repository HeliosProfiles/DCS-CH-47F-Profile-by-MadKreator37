This is a profile for Helios Virtual Cockpit software, for use with DCS World
This profile utilises an updated set of JSON interfaces which have been contributed to was written into the Helios Virtual Cockpit project called **Helios**.  This can be downloaded from [Helios latest release](https://github.com/HeliosVirtualCockpit/Helios/releases/latest)
### ABOUT

### Minimum Helios version required: 1.6.6110.0005

### Please download and install via the Helios16 installer under ASSETS. Do not clone the repo and copy the files. The profile will not function correctly!

This profile was designed and created by myself, in close collaboration with BlueFin. All parts were cut and modified from the 3d model of the CH-47F cockpit, texture files or replicas were designed and created from scratch. Every piece used is specific to the CH-47F.  The hope is to bring you the most complete, visually appealing and easy to use profile for the CH-47F in DCS that we could.  There are several added functions in the profile, such as buttons for the ramp controls, cargo and control indicators, rearm/refuel window, briefing menu, f-keys, kneeboard functions etc.

*NOTE*: The added functions:  F-keys Esc, Rearm, Briefing, kneeboard etc buttons require the default DCS keybindings for them to work properly. If you have altered any of these then some functions may not work as intended.

Special thanks to @BlueFinBima for all of his contributions including the interface, custom made controls, toolbox items, repository help and more!

### Notes

-Due to the wide range of displays, monitors, TV's and tablets,  I cannot guarantee exact brightness levels or color accuracy results from user to user. This is not something I have any control of. If you have visual issues (too bright or too dark etc)  please calibrate your display and/or adjust settings in your GPU's software, brightness, contrast, sharpness, gamma, digital vibrance etc.(highly recommended anyway). It will probably enhance all other profiles as well. During testing, the profile was used and shown on multiple displays, and types,  to rule out any "game breaking" visuals but it is impossible for me to account for every scenario.
